description: Execute a rigorous research process (Hypothesis -> 5x Search -> Refutation -> Refinement)

# Deep Research Command

Forces a rigorous, scientific approach to problem-solving. Prevents "jumping to conclusions" by enforcing hypothesis, evidence gathering, and self-correction.

**CRITICAL: Do not modify any code files during this process. Output findings only.**

## The Process (Repeat 3 Cycles)

### Cycle 1: Broad Exploration
1. **Hypothesis**: State initial understanding. "I believe the best approach is X because Y..."
2. **Evidence Gathering**: Perform **minimum 5 web searches**. Look for official docs, GitHub discussions, contrasting opinions.
3. **Antithesis**: Attack your own hypothesis. "Why might this fail? Edge cases? Simpler way?"
4. **Refinement**: Update mental model.

### Cycle 2: Deep Dive & Validation
1. **Refined Hypothesis**: More specific solution.
2. **Evidence Gathering**: **5 more web searches** targeting implementation details, error scenarios, version compatibility.
3. **Antithesis**: Look for gotchas, security issues, scale limitations.
4. **Refinement**: Polish the solution.

### Cycle 3: Edge Cases & Integration
1. **Final Hypothesis**: Near-complete solution.
2. **Evidence Gathering**: Search for integration issues, comparisons, common pitfalls.
3. **Antithesis**: "Is this over-engineered? Maintainable?"
4. **Conclusion**: Finalize findings.

## Final Output

1. **Executive Summary**: Recommended approach.
2. **Key Findings**: What was learned? Wrong assumptions?
3. **Trade-offs**: Pros/Cons vs alternatives.
4. **Proposed Plan**: High-level steps (do not implement).
5. **Sources**: Key URLs verified.
